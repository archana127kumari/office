    Neeraj Chopra (born 24 December 1997) is an Indian track and field athlete, who is the reigning Olympic champion and World champion in Men's javelin throw. He is the first Asian athlete to win an Olympic gold medal in javelin and the first Asian to win gold in his event at the World Championship. A Junior Commissioned Officer Subedar (JCO) in the Indian Army, Chopra is the first track and field athlete to win a gold medal for India at the Olympics.[5] He is also the first track and field athlete from India to win at the World Under-20 Championships, where in 2016 he achieved a world U20 record throw of 86.48 m, becoming the first Indian athlete to set a world record.

Chopra participated in the 2018 Commonwealth Games and the 2018 Asian Games, serving as the flag-bearer in the latter and winning gold medals in both. As of 2023, he is one of only two Indians to have won an individual Olympic gold medal (the other being Abhinav Bindra), the youngest-ever Indian Olympic gold medalist in an individual event and the only individual to have won gold on his Olympic debut.[6] His silver medal at the 2022 World Championships made him the second Indian to win a medal at a World Athletics Championships.[7] He subsequently won the first gold for India at the 2023 World Athletics Championships and second gold at 2022 Asian Games.[8][9]

Chopra is the Indian record holder for the javelin throw

2020. Two years later, he topped the podium at the World Athletics Championships 2023 in Budapest to become Indias first-ever world champion in any athletics discipline.Neeraj Chopras gold medal
at Tokyo 2020 was also India s second individual Olympic gold medal after shooter Abhinav Bindras 10m air rifle glory at Beijing 2008.Heading into the Tokyo Olympics, Neeraj Chopra was, at best, 
a dark horse in the mens javelin competition which featured a strong field consisting of overwhelming favourite Johannes Vetter, reigning world champion Anderson Peters, London 2012 gold medallist 
Keshorn Walcott, among others.

    Every time Neeraj Chopra picks up a javelin, the whole of India holds its breath.The Indian javelin throw ace, too, seldom disappoints, winning medals and setting new records with staggering consistency.Perhaps the highlight of Neeraj Chopra's short yet eventful career so far has been his gold medal win at Tokyo 2020.
    With a best throw of 87.58m in the finals, Neeraj Chopra, in his early twenties, became the first Indian track and field athlete to win Olympic gold and only the second Indian, after shooter Abhinav Bindra, to win an individual gold medal at the Summer GamesEven Neeraj Chopra's second-best throw of 87.03m at the Japan National Stadium during the Tokyo 2020 men's javelin throw finals would have been enough for the top podium finish. Czech Republic's Jakub Vadlejch won the silver with a throw of 86.67m.Interestingly, the 87.58m Olympic gold-winning throw, as significant as it may have been, isn't Neeraj Chopra's personal best. In fact, it barely makes into the top 10.
    Neeraj Chopra's best throw is 89.94m, achieved at the Stockholm Diamond League in Sweden on June 30, 2022. The mark stands as the men's national record in India and Neeraj Chopra's personal best.The previous three national records -- 89.30m at the Paavo Nurmi Games 2022, 88.07m at the 2021 Indian Grand Prix 3 in Patiala and 88.06m at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta -- also belonged to Neeraj Chopra.Neeraj Chopra's best at the World Athletics Championships came during the qualification round at Budapest 2023, where he threw an 88.77m. His effort in the 2022 final measured 88.13m, which earned India an historic silver. At the 2023 world championships, Neeraj Chopra threw the javelin 88.17m to win another historic medal, this time a gold, for India.Neeraj Chopra won the gold medal at the IAAF World U20 Championships 2016 in Bydgoszcz, Poland. This effort, which helped Chopra grab world attention, came on the back of an 86.48m attempt, an under-20 world record!
